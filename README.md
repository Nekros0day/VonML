# VonML

VonML is a minimal machine learning library written in pure Python and NumPy. It aims to provide simple implementations of basic algorithms that can be used for educational purposes or small projects.

## Features

* Linear regression
* Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network
* Activation and loss functions
* Backpropagation and an SGD trainer
* Small toy dataset generators
* Example scripts for regression and classification

## Installation

```
pip install -e .
```

## Examples

Run the example scripts to see the library in action:

```
python examples/regression_example.py
python examples/classification_example.py
```

The examples generate simple synthetic datasets, fit a model and display the result using `matplotlib`.
